# OpenSimulator Binaries

Download here pre-built binaries for the modules needed by the helpers. Download the dlls according to your OpenSim version and place them in your OpenSim bin/ directory.

This folder is not needed in your website, you can safely delete it once after copying the needed files to your OpenSim server.

If you don't find a version compatible with your setup, you can drop us a note, we might add pre-built binaries for your version in the repository.

Alternatively, you can build the binaries from sources.

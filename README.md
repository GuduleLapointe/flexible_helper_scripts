HG helper scripts
-----------------

This is a modification of NSL helpers scripts to allow better integration in
hypergrid environment.

Developed for Speculoos.world grid, it should be useable as is by other grids
(with config changes of course).

Based on Network System Laboratory scripts version 0.8.1, part of DTL/NSL project

DTL/NSL Project:

- run `./setup_dtl_nsl_scripts.sh` to install, 
- then edit config/config.php to add your grid specific settings

(if you run the setup script again, your config.php file will be preserved)
